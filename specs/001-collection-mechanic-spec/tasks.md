# Tasks: Collection Mechanic Plugin

**Input**: Design documents from `specs/001-collection-mechanic-spec/`

**Prerequisites**: plan.md ✅ | spec.md ✅ | research.md ✅ | data-model.md ✅ | contracts/ui-contract.md ✅

**Tests**: Not requested — no test tasks generated.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by phase. Phase 1 (remediation) and Phase 2 (foundational)
must complete before any user story phase begins. User stories can then proceed in priority order.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story?] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies on incomplete tasks)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (US1, US2, US3)
- File paths are relative to the repository root

---

## Phase 1: Setup — Constitution Remediation

**Purpose**: Bring existing code into compliance with constitution Principles II and V before any
feature work. File renames require a Lightroom restart to take effect.

**⚠️ CRITICAL**: Complete all Phase 1 tasks and perform the Lightroom restart (T007) before
beginning Phase 2. Lightroom will not detect renamed or new `.lua` files without a full restart.

- [X] T001 Rename `lrcollectionmechanic.lrdevplugin/UI_MainDialog.lua` to `UI__MainDialog.lua` (double underscore — Principle II)
- [X] T002 [P] Rename `lrcollectionmechanic.lrdevplugin/Util_StringUtils.lua` to `Util__StringUtils.lua` (double underscore — Principle II)
- [X] T003 [P] Rename `lrcollectionmechanic.lrdevplugin/Util_CatalogUtils.lua` to `Util__CatalogUtils.lua` (double underscore — Principle II)
- [X] T004 Update all `require` statements across `lrcollectionmechanic.lrdevplugin/CollectionMechanic.lua` and any other file that references the old single-underscore filenames to use the new double-underscore names
- [X] T005 [P] Verify `lrcollectionmechanic.lrdevplugin/Info.lua` defines `Info.PLUGINNAME` and `Info.LOGGERTARGET` on the `Info` object; add either field if missing
- [X] T005a [P] Verify `lrcollectionmechanic.lrdevplugin/Info.lua` registers the entry point under both `LrLibraryMenuItems` and `LrExportMenuItems`; add the missing registration if either is absent (FR-014)
- [X] T006 Create `lrcollectionmechanic.lrdevplugin/PluginInit.lua` — initialise `LrLogger(Info.PLUGINNAME)` and call `logger:enable(Info.LOGGERTARGET)`, then log a startup message (Principle V)
- [ ] T007 **[MANUAL]** Quit and restart Lightroom Classic so renamed files and `PluginInit.lua` are detected; reload plugin via Plug-in Manager and confirm no "Could not load toolkit script" errors in the log

**Checkpoint**: Plugin loads cleanly with double-underscore filenames and startup log entry visible.

---

## Phase 2: Foundational — Shared Infrastructure

**Purpose**: Core utilities and property table that ALL user stories depend on. No user story
work can begin until this phase is complete.

**⚠️ CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete.

- [X] T008 Implement `StringUtils.sanitizeCollectionName(name)` in `lrcollectionmechanic.lrdevplugin/Util__StringUtils.lua` — trim whitespace, replace `"*/:|\?<>` and `\` with `_`, collapse consecutive underscores, return `{sanitizedName, status}` where status is `"OK"`, `"MODIFIED"`, or `"ERROR"` per data-model.md sanitization rules
- [X] T009 [P] Implement `StringUtils.parseCollectionNames(input)` in `lrcollectionmechanic.lrdevplugin/Util__StringUtils.lua` — split on newlines (normalise `\r\n` and `\r` to `\n` first), trim each line, skip blank lines, apply `sanitizeCollectionName` to each, return array of `CollectionNameEntry` per data-model.md
- [X] T010 Implement `CatalogUtils.getCollectionSets()` in `lrcollectionmechanic.lrdevplugin/Util__CatalogUtils.lua` — depth-first recursive traversal of `catalog:getChildCollectionSets()` and each set's `getChildCollectionSets()`; build flat array of `{displayName, object}` where `displayName` is the full ancestry path joined with ` » `; obtain catalog via `LrApplication.activeCatalog()` inside the function per Principle I
- [X] T011 Define `PropertyTable` in `lrcollectionmechanic.lrdevplugin/CollectionMechanic.lua` using `LrBinding.makePropertyTable(context)` with fields: `filterText=""`, `allCollectionSets={}`, `filteredCollectionSets={}`, `selectedCollectionSet=nil`, `collectionNamesInput=""`, `dryRunResults={}`, `executionResults={}` per data-model.md
- [X] T012 Add module-level logger import to each of `CollectionMechanic.lua`, `UI__MainDialog.lua`, `Util__StringUtils.lua`, `Util__CatalogUtils.lua` in `lrcollectionmechanic.lrdevplugin/` — `local logger = import 'LrLogger'(Info.PLUGINNAME)` with no `:enable()` call (PluginInit handles that) per Principle V

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready — `sanitizeCollectionName`, `parseCollectionNames`, and
`getCollectionSets` all callable; PropertyTable initialises without error.

---

## Phase 3: User Story 1 — Batch Create Collections (Priority: P1) 🎯 MVP

**Goal**: User selects a collection set, enters names, clicks Execute, and collections are
created with sanitized names. Partial-success batches supported.

**Independent Test**: Select a collection set, enter three names (one with a special character),
click Execute — verify the execution results dialog shows 3 entries and all three collections
appear in Lightroom under the selected set.

### Implementation for User Story 1

- [X] T013 [US1] Populate `props.allCollectionSets` and `props.filteredCollectionSets` on dialog open in `lrcollectionmechanic.lrdevplugin/CollectionMechanic.lua` — call `CatalogUtils.getCollectionSets()` inside `LrFunctionContext` and assign results to both fields before showing dialog; log the count of sets found
- [X] T014 [US1] Build main dialog skeleton in `lrcollectionmechanic.lrdevplugin/UI__MainDialog.lua` — collection set popup row (bound to `props.filteredCollectionSets` / `props.selectedCollectionSet`), collection names multi-line text field (bound to `props.collectionNamesInput`), and button row with Dry Run, Execute, and Close buttons using `LrView` and `LrBinding`; return view to `CollectionMechanic.showCollectionMechanicDialog` for presentation via `LrDialogs.presentModalDialog`
- [X] T015 [US1] Implement `CatalogUtils.createCollections(targetSet, entries)` in `lrcollectionmechanic.lrdevplugin/Util__CatalogUtils.lua` — wrap all creation in `catalog:withWriteAccessDo`, iterate entries with status `~= "ERROR"`, before calling `createCollection` check for an existing collection with a matching name using `string.lower` comparison (FR-012 case-insensitive duplicate detection) and if found mark as success without creating, otherwise call `catalog:createCollection(entry.sanitizedName, targetSet, true)` inside `pcall`, populate `entry.created` and `entry.errorMessage`, return full results array (partial-success pattern from research.md D-006)
- [X] T016 [US1] Implement Execute validation in `lrcollectionmechanic.lrdevplugin/UI__MainDialog.lua` — check `props.selectedCollectionSet ~= nil` (show "Please select a collection set before proceeding." via `LrDialogs.message` if nil); check parsed names contain at least one non-ERROR entry (show "Please enter at least one collection name." if not); abort Execute if either check fails
- [X] T017 [US1] Implement Execute button handler in `lrcollectionmechanic.lrdevplugin/UI__MainDialog.lua` — call `StringUtils.parseCollectionNames(props.collectionNamesInput)`, run validation (T016), call `CatalogUtils.createCollections`, store results in `props.executionResults`, trigger Execution Results dialog
- [X] T018 [US1] Build Execution Results dialog in `lrcollectionmechanic.lrdevplugin/UI__MainDialog.lua` — summary line "Successfully created X collection(s)", error details table (columns: Name | Sanitized | Reason) shown only when at least one ERROR exists, single Close button per ui-contract.md Execution Results Dialog section
- [X] T019 [US1] Log Execute operations in `lrcollectionmechanic.lrdevplugin/UI__MainDialog.lua` and `Util__CatalogUtils.lua` — `logger:info` for operation start (collection set name, name count), `logger:warn` per skipped ERROR entry, `logger:info` for completion summary (created count, error count)

**Checkpoint**: User Story 1 fully functional — batch creation works, partial failures reported,
results dialog shows correct summary. Test independently before moving to US2.

---

## Phase 4: User Story 2 — Dry Run Preview (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: User can preview name transformations (including character sanitization) without
modifying the catalog. Status shown per name (OK / MODIFIED / ERROR).

**Independent Test**: Enter names including special characters, click Dry Run — verify the
results table shows correct original/sanitized/status for each name; open Lightroom Collections
panel and confirm no new collections were created.

### Implementation for User Story 2

- [X] T020 [US2] Implement Dry Run validation in `lrcollectionmechanic.lrdevplugin/UI__MainDialog.lua` — check parsed names contain at least one non-empty line after trimming; show "Please enter at least one collection name." via `LrDialogs.message` on failure; no collection set check required for Dry Run
- [X] T021 [US2] Implement Dry Run button handler in `lrcollectionmechanic.lrdevplugin/UI__MainDialog.lua` — call `StringUtils.parseCollectionNames(props.collectionNamesInput)`, run validation (T020), store result array in `props.dryRunResults` (no catalog writes), trigger Dry Run Results dialog
- [X] T022 [US2] Build Dry Run Results dialog in `lrcollectionmechanic.lrdevplugin/UI__MainDialog.lua` — header "Dry Run complete. No collections were created.", scrollable three-column table (Original Name | Sanitized Name | Status), summary note based on status mix, Close button per ui-contract.md Dry Run Results Dialog section
- [X] T023 [US2] Log Dry Run operations in `lrcollectionmechanic.lrdevplugin/UI__MainDialog.lua` — `logger:info` for operation (name count, OK count, MODIFIED count, ERROR count)

**Checkpoint**: User Stories 1 AND 2 both work independently. Dry Run never modifies catalog;
Execute creates with correct sanitized names.

---

## Phase 5: User Story 3 — Collection Set Filter (Priority: P3)

**Goal**: Filter field above the collection set selector narrows the list by case-insensitive
partial name match. Selection persists when filter changes.

**Independent Test**: Open the dialog on a catalog with 5+ collection sets. Type a partial name
in the filter field — selector narrows to matching sets. Clear the filter — all sets reappear.
Select a set, then type a different filter — selected set remains in `props.selectedCollectionSet`
even if hidden. Click Execute — operation uses the still-selected set.

### Implementation for User Story 3

- [X] T024 [US3] Add filter field row above the collection set popup in `lrcollectionmechanic.lrdevplugin/UI__MainDialog.lua` — single-line text field with label "Collection Set Filter", bound two-way to `props.filterText`, placeholder "Type to filter collection sets...", positioned immediately above the collection set selector per ui-contract.md Filter Field spec; collection set popup label is "Base Collection Set"
- [X] T025 [US3] Implement filter observer in `lrcollectionmechanic.lrdevplugin/CollectionMechanic.lua` or `UI__MainDialog.lua` — observe `props.filterText` changes; recompute `props.filteredCollectionSets` from `props.allCollectionSets` using `string.find(string.lower(displayName), string.lower(filterText), 1, true) ~= nil`; assign full list when `filterText` is empty (case-insensitive plain-text match per research.md D-003)
- [X] T026 [US3] Verify selection-persistence in `lrcollectionmechanic.lrdevplugin/UI__MainDialog.lua` — confirm `props.selectedCollectionSet` is NOT reset when `props.filteredCollectionSets` changes; Execute and Dry Run must use the stored selection regardless of current filter state

**Checkpoint**: All three user stories independently functional. Filter narrows correctly,
clears correctly, and does not disturb existing selection.

---

## Phase N: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

**Purpose**: Final quality pass across all user stories.

- [X] T027 Verify button row layout in `lrcollectionmechanic.lrdevplugin/UI__MainDialog.lua` — Dry Run and Execute buttons on the left side of the action row, Close as the single standard action button on the right; no separate OK or Cancel buttons present per research.md D-007 and ui-contract.md Button Row spec
- [X] T028 [P] Audit all `logger:*` calls across `lrcollectionmechanic.lrdevplugin/` — confirm `logger:info` for normal operations, `logger:warn` for recoverable issues (e.g., skipped ERROR names), `logger:error` for unexpected failures; no important operation left unlogged per constitution Principle V
- [X] T029 [P] Search all `.lua` files in `lrcollectionmechanic.lrdevplugin/` for any remaining `require` or `import` references to single-underscore filenames (`UI_`, `Util_`) and update to double-underscore equivalents per constitution Principle II
- [ ] T030 **[MANUAL]** Follow `specs/001-collection-mechanic-spec/quickstart.md` happy path in Lightroom Classic — install plugin, create 3 collections, verify character sanitization workflow, check log output; confirm all three user stories pass their independent tests end-to-end

---

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Phase 1 (Setup/Remediation)**: No dependencies — start immediately. T007 (restart) MUST complete before Phase 2.
- **Phase 2 (Foundational)**: Depends on Phase 1 + T007 restart — BLOCKS all user stories.
- **Phase 3 (US1)**: Depends on Phase 2. T013 → T014 → T015 → T016/T017 → T018 → T019.
- **Phase 4 (US2)**: Depends on Phase 2. Can run concurrently with Phase 3 if desired; T020/T021 reuse `parseCollectionNames` from T009.
- **Phase 5 (US3)**: Depends on Phase 2. T024 requires T014 (main dialog skeleton) to exist.
- **Polish (Phase N)**: Depends on all desired user story phases being complete.

### Within Phase 3 (US1)

```
T013 (populate sets on open)
  ↓
T014 (dialog skeleton) ← required by T015, T016, T017, T018
  ↓
T015 [P] (createCollections) ← T016 [P] (Execute validation)
  ↓                                   ↓
T017 (Execute handler — depends on T015 + T016)
  ↓
T018 (Execution Results dialog)
  ↓
T019 (logging — can be woven in throughout)
```

### Parallel Opportunities

```
# Phase 1 — run together after T001:
T002, T003 (file renames — different files)
T005 (Info.lua — independent)

# Phase 2 — run together:
T008, T009 (StringUtils functions — same file, sequence within file)
T010 (CatalogUtils — different file from T008/T009)
T012 (logger imports — multiple files, independent)

# Phase 3 — after T014:
T015 (createCollections) and T016 (validation) can be written in parallel
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup/Remediation (includes Lightroom restart)
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Follow quickstart.md Execute happy path independently
5. Proceed to US2 when US1 is confirmed working

### Incremental Delivery

1. Phase 1 + Phase 2 → Foundation ready
2. Phase 3 → Execute works → Test US1 independently
3. Phase 4 → Dry Run works → Test US2 independently
4. Phase 5 → Filter works → Test US3 independently
5. Phase N → Polish and full end-to-end validation

## Notes

- `[P]` tasks = different files or independent functions, no blocking dependencies
- `[US1/US2/US3]` label maps task to its user story for traceability
- **[MANUAL]** tasks require developer action in Lightroom; cannot be automated
- File renames (T001–T003) are git operations: `git mv` preserves history
- After T007 (restart), verify plugin loads before proceeding — check log for startup message
- `canReturnPrior=true` is passed to `createCollection` as a safety net, but T015 implements an explicit `string.lower` pre-check for case-insensitive duplicate detection per FR-012 before calling the SDK
- The filter observer (T025) should use LrBinding's observer pattern, not a polling approach
